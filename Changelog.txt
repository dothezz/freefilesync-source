FreeFileSync
------------

Changelog v1.6
--------------
Significantly improved speed of filtering files and view (< 10 ms for > 200.000 rows(!))
Fixed minor grid mis-alignment under some special conditions
Enhanced status bar with centered texts
Flexible filter options depending on compare variant
Improved synchronization statistics
Fixed issue when trying to delete system folders
Usability improvements
Recycle Bin usage as commandline parameter
New menu bar
Program language selectable from menu
UI-option to create sync jobs (batch files) for automated synchronization


Changelog v1.5
--------------
Improved speed of comparison by file content
Simplified and optimized calculation of accumulated filesizes
Added right-click context menu to main dialog
New installer for Windows
Improved usability of filtering and selecting rows
Solved possible issue with different file time precisions in multi-OS environments
Updated German translation


Changelog v1.4
--------------
Implemented generic multithreading class to keep "compare by content" and "file synchronisation" responsive
Added status bar when comparing files (with additional status information for "compare by content")
Some further speed optimizations 
Added option to skip error messages and have them listed after synchronization
Restructured loading of configuration files
The result grid after synchronization now always consists of items that have not been synchronized (even if abort was pressed)
Added "remaining files" as sync-progress information
Updated German translation


Changelog v1.3
--------------
Maintain and load different configurations by drag&drop, load-button or commandline
New function to delete files (or move them to recycle bin) manually on the UI (without having to re-compare):
	Deleting folders results in deletion of all dependent files, subfolders on UI grid (also no re-compare needed)
	while catching arrow situations and allowing to resolve them
Improved manual filtering of rows: If folders are marked all dependent subfolders and files are marked as well 
(keeping sort sequence when "hide filtered elements" is marked)
Comprehensive performance optimization of the two features above (manual filtering, deletion) for large grids (> 200.000 rows)
Improved usability: resizable borders, keyboard shortcuts, default buttons, dialog standard focus
Main window will remember restored position even if maximized
Updated sources to become more Linux and Unicode friendly
Updated German translation


Changelog v1.2
--------------
New progress indicator and status information when synchronizing:
	->available for commandline mode and UI mode: Status update and final error report
New progress information when comparing directories
Multithreading for copying of files to keep program responsive
Optimized all status dialogs and progress indicators for high performance: practically NO performance loss
Possibility to abort all performance critical operations (comparison, synchronization) at any time
New options in case of an error: "Continue, retry, abort" for UI and commandline
New commandline option "-skiperrors" to continue synchronization despite errors
Enhanced logfile (-silent mode) to include all errors during compare and synchronization
Do not synchronize folders that have been deleted externally (but show an error message)
Manually filter out ranges from synchronization instead of just single rows
Some UI improvements
New option to use Recycle Bin when deleting or overwriting files
New synchronization sequence: first delete files, then copy files to avoid disc space shortages
Added different return values when used in commandline mode to report success or failure
Updated German translation


Changelog v1.1
--------------
Some further speed optimizations (sorting)
Written custom wxGrid class to avoid mapping of data to UI: huge performance increase (especially with formatted grids > 100000 items)
Filter files to include/exclude them from synchronization
Minor UI and text adaptions
Allow direct keyboard input for directory names
Updated German translation
Added possibility to continue on error
Added indicator for sort direction
Simplified code concerning loading of UI resources
Prepared code to support unicode in some future version

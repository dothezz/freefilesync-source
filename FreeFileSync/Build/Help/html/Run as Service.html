		RealtimeSync is designed to run as a background process which does not need further
		attention. Depending on your requirements there are a number of ways to start it automatically.
		Generally the goal is to execute a command line of the form:
	</P>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="greybox_inner">
				<span class="command_line">&lt;FreeFileSync installation folder&gt;\RealtimeSync.exe &lt;path to *.ffs_real or *.ffs_batch file&gt;</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

	<BR>
	<BR>

	<h3>Example:</h3>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="greybox_inner">
				<span class="command_line">&quot;C:\Program Files\FreeFileSync\RealtimeSync.exe&quot; &quot;D:\Backup Projects.ffs_real&quot;</span>
		</div>
	</div>

		<LI><p>RealtimeSync should be monitoring while a user is logged in:<br>

		<LI><p>RealtimeSync should be monitoring while Windows is running irrespective of currently logged in users:<br>
		Create a new task in your operating systems's task scheduler and have it execute the command line above
		when the system starts. See <A HREF="Schedule%20a%20batch%20job.html">Schedule a Batch Job</A> for an example how to add a task. Then change
		the user which runs the task to <B>SYSTEM</B> - a special user account always running in the background.

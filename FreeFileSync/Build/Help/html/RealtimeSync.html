	<P>The primary purpose of RealtimeSync is to execute a command line each time it detects changes in one of the monitored directories
	<b>or</b> when a directory becomes available (e. g. insert of a USB-stick). Usually this command line will trigger a FreeFileSync batch job.
	</P>

	<BR>

	<B>Example:</B> Real time synchronization - in combination with FreeFileSync<br>
	<P>
	Start RealtimeSync.exe located in FreeFileSync's installation directory and 
	enter all folders you want to monitor. Instead of doing this manually you can import a ffs_batch
	file via <B>Menu &rarr; File &rarr; Open</B>. This not only extracts all directories relevant for synchronization
	but also sets up the command line to execute the ffs_batch file each time changes are detected.
	Now press <B>Start</B> to begin monitoring.

					<LI>RealtimeSync will skip showing the main dialog and begin monitoring immediately if

	<B>Example:</B> Automatic synchronization when a USB stick is inserted
	<P>Save a ffs_batch configuration in the USB stick's root directory, 
	e.g. <span class="file_path">H:\</span>, to let RealtimeSync call it when the stick is mounted. Configure RealtimeSync as follows:<BR>
	</P>
	<div STYLE="margin-left: 1.3cm">

	</div>
	<BR>

	<P>Whenever directory <span class="file_path">H:\Data</span> becomes available, RealtimeSync executes the command line which starts the batch job located
	on the stick. RealtimeSync will also trigger each time files are modified in <span class="file_path">H:\Data</span>.
